I'm a Network and Telecommunication Engineering student with more than 10 years of practical experience working across networking, infrastructure, and systems administration.

My focus areas include:

- Networking & infrastructure design, troubleshooting, and optimization (LAN/WAN, routing, switching, VLANs, VPNs).
- Deployment and maintenance of media server ecosystems, especially Plex and Jellyfin.
- Linux server administration (Debian/Ubuntu/CentOS derivatives) and automation for reliable, secure services.
- Windows Server administration and integration in mixed OS environments.
- System administration, monitoring, and capacity planning to keep services performant and available.

I enjoy building robust, maintainable infrastructure and automating repetitive tasks to reduce operational overhead. I have hands-on experience deploying media servers, configuring network services, managing backups and storage, and supporting both small and medium-scale production systems.

If you'd like to collaborate, ask about infrastructure, or need help with media-server setup and maintenance, reach out and we'll find a solution.
